Progress:

Current assessment: poor. (1/5)

1. Am I implementing the "Unix 'cat' program" or https://esolangs.org/wiki/Cat_program. I assume the latter.

2. I feel I need to understand effects and handlers first. I am trying to get my head around these. I feel maybe a chat around these may be useful.
