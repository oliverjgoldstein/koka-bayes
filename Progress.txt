Progress:

Current assessment: poor. (1/5)

1. Am I implementing the "Unix 'cat' program" or https://esolangs.org/wiki/Cat_program. I assume the latter.

2. I feel I need to understand effects and handlers first. I am trying to get my head around these. I feel maybe a chat around these may be useful.

3. Update #1: I am looking into https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/algeff-tr-2016-v3.pdf and trying to understand it deep enough to make it work.

4. I understand the amb handler as well as the input handler.
I am trying to understand the state handler.
